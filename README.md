# DanceTeacherApp
The Dance Teacher App will allow dance teachers to keep track of information about their clients. The program will allow the teacher to create and update student files. The teacher will be able to sell or refund lessons, monitor attendance, keep track of money spent for each student, keep track of the last time student attended a class, let the teacher know if it is the student’s birthday, or print all information from the student’s file to the console window.  Another benefit is that it frees up valuable space that is usually taken up by bulky student files. This program is intended for the dance teacher or dance studio’s front desk person exclusively, not for use by student.
I have included both GUI and console log versions of the Dance Teacher App. Both applications save student data to individual local files, and access those files to update the students’ records.
